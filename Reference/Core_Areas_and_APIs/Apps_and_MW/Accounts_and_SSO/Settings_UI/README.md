## Settings UI

The settings UI for a provider must be located at `/usr/share/accounts/ui/` and named `<provider>-settings.qml` where `<provider>` matches the [name](https://sailfishos.org/develop/docs/sailfish-accounts/qml-sailfishaccounts-provider.html/#name-prop) of the [Provider](https://sailfishos.org/develop/docs/sailfish-accounts/qml-sailfishaccounts-provider.html/).

The root element of the Settings UI should be `AccountSettingsAgent` which is available via `import com.jolla.settings.account 1.0`. 

The implementation must:

1. Set the initialPage property (i.e. the first page in the account flow) to a page
2. Emit accountDeletionRequested() signal and pop the page when the user wants to delete the account.

`AccountSettingsAgent` provides some convenience properties, which are set to valid values on construction:

| Property        | Type                                                                                                             | Description                                                           |
| --------        | ----                                                                                                             | -----------                                                           |
| accountId       | int                                                                                                              | ID of the account to be displayed                                     |
| accountProvider | [Provider](https://sailfishos.org/develop/docs/sailfish-accounts/qml-sailfishaccounts-provider.html)             | Provider this account is specified for                                |
| accountManager  | [AccountManager](https://sailfishos.org/develop/docs/sailfish-accounts/qml-sailfishaccounts-accountmanager.html) | Provides information about existing providers, services, and accounts |

### OnlineSyncAccountSettingsAgent

The settings application comes with a helper component `OnlineSyncAccountSettingsAgent` which can be used for implementing Settings UI. It takes care of configuring accounts, and also configuring [Buteo sync profiles](/Reference/Core_Areas_and_APIs/Apps_and_MW/Synchronization/#sync-profiles) if necessary.

`OnlineSyncAccountsSettingsAgent` can be used as a root element of the Settings UI. It has two properties, which must be set: `services` and `sharedScheduleServices`. Both of these are arrays to [Service](https://sailfishos.org/develop/docs/sailfish-accounts/qml-sailfishaccounts-service.html/) elements. Please see e.g. Nextcloud implementation for example how to use the provided [accountManager](https://sailfishos.org/develop/docs/sailfish-accounts/qml-sailfishaccounts-accountmanager.html) to get these.

`services` contains all services provided by the provider. `sharedScheduleServices` contais services which have a synchronization schedule configured in the account settings UI.


## Account creation UI

The UI for creating an account must be located at `/usr/share/accounts/ui/` and named `<provider>.qml` where `<provider>` matches the [name](https://sailfishos.org/develop/docs/sailfish-accounts/qml-sailfishaccounts-provider.html/#name-prop) of the [Provider](https://sailfishos.org/develop/docs/sailfish-accounts/qml-sailfishaccounts-provider.html/).

The root element of the settings UI should be `AccountCreationAgent` which is available via `import com.jolla.settings.account 1.0`. 

The implementation must:

1. Set the initialPage property (i.e. the first page in the account flow) to a Page or Dialog
2. Ensure the page that follows the last account creation page is the provided endDestination.

For example, a typical implementation of a UI flow would be:

1. Set initialPage to be a Dialog that allows the user to enter username and password details
2. When the dialog is accepted, show a page with a busy-spinner animation while creating the account asynchronously in the background. 
 - If the account is created, show the account settings dialog to allow the user to confirm or customize particular settings. When the settings dialog is accepted, save the updated settings and move onto the endDestination. If the save operation is asynchronous, set `delayDeletion=true` until the save is done (or fails) to prevent the agent instance from being deleted until the operation completes.
 - If the account cannot be created, allow the user to go back to try again, or move onto the endDestination if the retry action is not possible.

AccountCreationAgent provides two convenience properties, which will be set to valid values on construction: `accountManager` which is an instance of [AccountManager](https://sailfishos.org/develop/docs/sailfish-accounts/qml-sailfishaccounts-accountmanager.html), and `accountProvider`, which is a [Provider](https://sailfishos.org/develop/docs/sailfish-accounts/qml-sailfishaccounts-provider.html) for this account.
